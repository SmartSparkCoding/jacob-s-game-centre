Welcome to Jacob's Game Centre!

This was created by me, Jacob, and I have distributed it across other people. 

The idea of having a game system where people can play games and have fun just made me happy, and so I created this.

But not without help from many people...

Obviously, I have made some games on my platform, but there are games from Tristan, Will and others. 

Not forgetting, the amazing SCRATCHERS! These amazing people (including people on TurboWarp) create amazing games, and I am happy to add them to my system (using the Turbowarp Packager, of course! Thank you so much for this tool). 

And thank you to you! For using this! 

If it wasn't for you, this app wouldn't exist (or be useless).

Thank you so much, and enjoy GAME CENTRE!
